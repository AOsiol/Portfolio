          I have a background in fine woodworking, construction, team
          management, and project management principles. I have owned my own
          woodworking business where I was involved in all aspects of the
          business cycle. I was responsible for marketing, building
          relationships with architects, builders and local craftspeople. I
          worked with individual clients with design and scheduling. I led the
          production, installation and closing of projects. Most recently, at
          the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, I managed the exhibition production
          team where I was involved in every step of project development from
          design, led teams during execution, maintained quality control,
          collaborated with other departments to meet exhibition goals. Both
          fine woodworking and web development are crafts that require a variety
          of technical skills, passion and keeping up to date in regards to new
          technologies and building practices. I have an interest in learning a
          new skill that is multi faceted and transportable. I earned a
          certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of
          Richmond. Experienced with skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript with
          jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, and React.js, Databases MongoDB and
          MySQL, & Version Control with Git and GitHub. It is my technical
          expertise, passion, and leadership that make me an advantageous
          candidate for any team.
